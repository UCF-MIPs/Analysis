To do    
-auto-thresholding to find value needed to generate given number of nodes in tree     
-integrate betweenness-centrality based node importance function to automatically select root nodes
-simplify everything into basic functionality for use in the MIPs interface and place into core dir, only output trees and pathways, no plots
