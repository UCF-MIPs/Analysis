To do    
-auto-thresholding to find value needed to generate given number of nodes in tree     
-add cascade generation       
-maybe add multi-edge with colors corresponding to influence types       
-multiroot trees  
-clean bluebox  
-add axes distributions to UFTM classification scatter plot (or somehow better show distribution)
